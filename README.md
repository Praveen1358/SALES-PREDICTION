# SALES-PREDICTION
The Employee Salary Prediction project is a web app that predicts if an individual's income is <=50K or >50K using a pre-trained ML model on the Adult Income Dataset. Users input details like age, education, occupation, and hours worked, and the backend processes this data to return a salary category.
